# Do you want views on YouTube easy peasy? 

Try this program out for a change. If you know anything about SEO, you can combine your knowledge with this program to produce an semi-automated channel. 

I spend 10 minutes a day scrolling through TikTok to find good, quality videos to upload on my semi-automated channel. 

Afterwards, I just add import them, add my YouTube API key in JSON format, install all the required .py libraries, and then run it on a VPS.

Trust me, it simplifies running a YouTube shorts channel a bit.



## Currently this is being turned into a Discord bot you can use to send a link to.

When that happens, all you're going to have to do is send your links to a Discord bot and it'll handle the rest for you. 

Thank for you reading!
